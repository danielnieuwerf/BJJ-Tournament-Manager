# BJJ-Tournament-Manager

Currently developing a BJJ tournament management platform. The goal of this project is to develop a website similar to smoothcomp.com. I'm developing the backend in C++, testing my code in the console using Microsoft Visual Studio. Run the BJJTournamentManager.cpp file to see the current functionality.

Current features:
- Create a new tournament
- Set the tournament divisions
- Add and remove participants to the tournament
- Close registration and create brackets for each division
- Each fighter has their own profile they can view

To do list:
- Fix the brackets so that team mates are put on opposite sides of the bracket
- Fix the brackets so that the number of byes are spread fairly in the bracket
- Create an in-play scoreboard
- Add match results to fighter profiles
- Add more division packages e.g ADCC weight classes, kids and juvenile divisions
